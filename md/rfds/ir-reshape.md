# RFD: IR Reshape — Symbols, Scope, and Two-Layer Architecture

**Status:** Partially Implemented (Phase 1 & 2 complete, Phase 3 not started)

**Supersedes:**
- [Symbol-Level Signature Queries](./symbol-signatures.md) (partially implemented, to be reworked)

## Problem

The current IR has accumulated accidental complexity:

1. **`SourceRoot` threaded everywhere** — signature queries, body resolution, and type checking all take `(module, source_root)` as explicit parameters. Callers must compute the defining module themselves.

2. **Exposed intermediate body representation** — CST → resolved body (`RExpr`) → type checking. The resolved-but-untyped middle layer (`ResolvedBody`) is currently a public, separately-queryable artifact. No consumer wants it without types — it should be internal to a single body query.

3. **`ScopeSymbol` is underweight** — it's a single-variant enum wrapping `ModSymbol`. The original design called for items to know their scope, but the current implementation computes it ad-hoc.

## Goal

Symbols know their scope. Queries are single-keyed. The body pipeline
is two steps internally (resolve → infer) but one query externally.

```
TreeSitter file
    │
    ▼ (parse — mints per-item symbols with CST stashes)
LocalModSymbol + LocalStructSymbol / LocalFnSymbol / ...
    │                              │
    │                              ▼ (sig query: resolve types via scope)
    │                              │
    │                              ▼ (body query: resolve names → infer types)
    │                          Typed IR (Ty, FnSig, TypedBody)
    ▼
module tree (for name resolution)
```

From the outside, each symbol has a single-keyed `sig()` or `body()` query.
Internally, `body()` first builds a `ResolvedBody` and then runs type inference.
This keeps the two concerns decoupled in implementation without exposing the
intermediate representation to callers. A future RFD may fuse them into a single
walk.

## Design

### CST layer and symbol minting

TreeSitter parses source text. We walk the tree once, minting per-item
symbols with per-item CST stashes. Parsing runs in multiple queries —
once for each source file and once for each macro expansion — but
always produces symbols directly:

```rust
#[salsa::input]
struct SourceFile {
    path: String,
    text: String,
}

// Parse a source file → module symbol containing item symbols
#[salsa::tracked]
fn parse_file<'db>(db: &'db dyn Db, file: SourceFile, scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>) -> LocalModSymbol<'db> { ... }

// Parse macro expansion output → additional item symbols
#[salsa::tracked]
fn parse_expansion<'db>(db: &'db dyn Db, exp: MacroExpansion<'db>, scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>) -> Vec<LocalSymbol<'db>> { ... }
```

The `scope` parameter tells the parser which module/crate the parsed
items belong to. For the initial file parse, the driver supplies the
crate-level scope. For macro expansions, the expansion machinery
supplies the scope of the module where the macro was invoked.

CST nodes mirror TreeSitter structure. They live in per-item stashes with relative spans. Nothing smart — just syntax.

```rust
struct StructCst<'db> {
    name: Name<'db>,
    generics: Slice<GenericParamCst<'db>>,
    fields: Slice<FieldCst<'db>>,
    where_clauses: Slice<WhereClauseCst<'db>>,
}

struct FieldCst<'db> {
    name: Name<'db>,
    ty: Ptr<TypeCst<'db>>,  // syntax-level type reference
}

struct FnCst<'db> {
    name: Name<'db>,
    generics: Slice<GenericParamCst<'db>>,
    params: Slice<ParamCst<'db>>,
    ret: Option<Ptr<TypeCst<'db>>>,
    body: Ptr<ExprCst<'db>>,
    where_clauses: Slice<WhereClauseCst<'db>>,
}
```

### Naming conventions and symbol taxonomy

The symbol layer has two kinds of leaf type:

- **`LocalFooSymbol`** — a salsa tracked struct, parsed from source. Owns its CST and scope.
- **`ExternalFooSymbol`** — a handle into rustc metadata (`CrateNum`, `DefIndex`).

These leaves are packaged into **grouping enums** at various levels of specificity:

```rust
// Per-kind grouping: local or external
enum StructSymbol<'db> {
    Local(LocalStructSymbol<'db>),
    External(ExternalStructSymbol<'db>),
}

enum ModSymbol<'db> {
    Local(LocalModSymbol<'db>),
    External(ExternalModSymbol<'db>),
}

// Provenance grouping: any local item, any external item
enum LocalSymbol<'db> {
    Struct(LocalStructSymbol<'db>),
    Fn(LocalFnSymbol<'db>),
    Enum(LocalEnumSymbol<'db>),
    Mod(LocalModSymbol<'db>),
    // ...
}

enum ExternalSymbol<'db> {
    Struct(ExternalStructSymbol<'db>),
    Fn(ExternalFnSymbol<'db>),
    // ...
}

// Top-level: anything
enum Symbol<'db> {
    Struct(StructSymbol<'db>),
    Fn(FnSymbol<'db>),
    Enum(EnumSymbol<'db>),
    Mod(ModSymbol<'db>),
    Intrinsic(Intrinsic),
    // ...
}
```

**Key design rules:**

- Grouping enums only expose methods that *all* their variants support. For enums bridging local/external (like `StructSymbol`), this means the shared interface is fully resolved, fully typed results — since that's all rustc metadata provides. CST, scope, and resolution machinery are internal to the `Local*` leaf types and never visible through the grouping enum.

- Use the most precise enum possible. A `LocalModSymbol`'s item list contains `LocalSymbol` values (never external items — those are parsed from source). A `pub use` redirect *resolves* to an external symbol at query time, but the module's own items are always local.

Derives generate:
- **`From` impls** — e.g., `LocalStructSymbol → StructSymbol → Symbol`, `LocalStructSymbol → LocalSymbol → Symbol`. Use `#[derive(FromImpls)]` (exists in `~/dev/dada`, `dada-util-procmacro`): generates `From<FieldType> for Self` for each single-field variant. `#[no_from_impl]` opts out specific variants.
- **Delegating methods** — match on the enum, forward to the method on each leaf. E.g., `StructSymbol::sig(db)` dispatches to `LocalStructSymbol::sig` or `ExternalStructSymbol::sig`. (Separate derive TBD.)

```rust
#[derive(FromImpls)]
enum StructSymbol<'db> {
    Local(LocalStructSymbol<'db>),
    External(ExternalStructSymbol<'db>),
}
```

### Module and symbol layer

**Leaf types:**

```rust
#[salsa::tracked]
struct LocalModSymbol<'db> {
    source: LocalModSource<'db>,
    scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>,
}

struct ExternalModSymbol<'db> {
    crate_num: CrateNum,
    def_index: DefIndex,
}

enum LocalModSource<'db> {
    File(SourceFile),
    Inline(ModItems<'db>),
}

struct ModItems<'db> {
    items: Stashed<Slice<ModItem<'db>>>,
}
```

Each item symbol is a salsa tracked struct that knows its enclosing scope:

```rust
#[salsa::tracked]
struct LocalStructSymbol<'db> {
    scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>,
    cst: Stashed<StructCst<'db>>,
}

#[salsa::tracked]
struct LocalFnSymbol<'db> {
    scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>,
    cst: Stashed<FnCst<'db>>,
}
```

### `ScopeSymbol`: the resolution environment

```rust
enum ScopeSymbol<'db> {
    Crate(LocalCrateSymbol<'db>),
    Module(LocalModSymbol<'db>),
    Fn(LocalFnSymbol<'db>),
}
```

Resolution starts from the scope and walks upward through the module
tree. Since `LocalModSymbol` knows its own scope (its parent module or
crate), the resolver can chain upward without any external parameters.

The `Fn` variant is needed for items defined inside function bodies
(closures, inner functions). Most items have `ScopeSymbol::Module` or
`ScopeSymbol::Crate` as their scope.

### Signature and body queries

Queries are keyed on the symbol alone. The scope provides everything needed for resolution:

```rust
impl<'db> LocalStructSymbol<'db> {
    #[salsa::tracked]
    pub fn sig(self, db: &'db dyn Db) -> StructSig<'db> {
        // reads self.cst, resolves type paths via self.scope
    }

    #[salsa::tracked]
    pub fn fields(self, db: &'db dyn Db) -> StructFields<'db> {
        // reads sig, resolves field types
    }
}

impl<'db> LocalFnSymbol<'db> {
    #[salsa::tracked]
    pub fn sig(self, db: &'db dyn Db) -> FnSig<'db> { ... }

    #[salsa::tracked]
    pub fn body(self, db: &'db dyn Db) -> TypedBody<'db> {
        // internally: resolve names → then infer types
        // from outside: one query, one result
    }
}
```

The `body()` query internally runs resolution (producing a `ResolvedBody`) and then type inference sequentially. From the caller's perspective this is atomic — there is no separately-queryable intermediate representation. A future RFD may fuse these into a single walk for performance, but the external API is already correct.

### Typed IR output

`Ty` / `TyData` remain essentially unchanged — stash-allocated, same variants (`Adt`, `Ref`, `Param`, intrinsics, etc.).

`TypedBody` wraps the resolved body plus its type-check result:

```rust
struct TypedBody<'db> {
    resolved: ResolvedBody<'db>,
    diagnostics: Vec<Diagnostic<'db>>,
    stash: Stash,
}
```

Internally, `ResolvedBody` and the R-expression types (`RExpr`, `RStmt`, etc.) survive as implementation details of the body query. They are not exposed through the public symbol API. A future RFD may fuse resolution and inference into a single walk; until then they run sequentially inside the query.

### What gets deleted

- `*_defining_module` helpers in `scope.rs` — symbols know their scope
- `SourceRoot` parameter threading — absorbed into the module/crate hierarchy
- `SigLowerCtx` as a standalone struct — its logic folds into the sig query methods on `LocalStructSymbol`, `LocalFnSymbol`, etc. (the resolver construction and rib setup become local to each query)
- Public visibility of `resolve_body` — becomes internal to the `body()` query

## Open questions

- **Parent linkage on `LocalModSymbol`**: does a module store its parent explicitly, or is containment derived from the crate's module tree? (The `scope` field may already suffice if `ScopeSymbol::Module(parent)` or `ScopeSymbol::Crate(c)` is the parent.)

## Implementation plan

The implementation proceeds in three phases. Each phase keeps the system
functional with passing tests — no big-bang rewrite.

The implementation plan uses existing type names (e.g., `ModSymbol`,
`FnAst`) where it refers to the current codebase state, and target
names (e.g., `LocalModSymbol`, `LocalFnSymbol`) where it refers to new
types being introduced.

### Phase 1: Absorb `SourceRoot` into the crate/scope hierarchy

**Goal:** Queries derive `SourceRoot` from the scope chain rather than
receiving it as a parameter.

**Step 1a — Introduce `LocalCrateSymbol`:**

```rust
#[salsa::input]
struct LocalCrateSymbol<'db> {
    root_mod: ModAst<'db>,
    source_root: SourceRoot,
}
```

The driver creates one of these instead of holding separate
`ModSymbol` + `SourceRoot`. `SageContext` wraps a `LocalCrateSymbol`.
This is purely additive.

**Step 1b — Wire `ScopeSymbol::Crate` variant:**

```rust
enum ScopeSymbol<'db> {
    Crate(LocalCrateSymbol<'db>),
    Module(ModSymbol<'db>),       // existing type, migrated in Phase 2
}
```

Add `ScopeSymbol::source_root(db) -> SourceRoot` that either reads
directly from `LocalCrateSymbol` or walks `ModSymbol.parent` up to the
crate root. This is the key bridge.

The `Fn` variant from the target design is not needed yet — it arrives
in Phase 2 alongside `LocalFnSymbol`.

**Step 1c — Internal `source_root` in `Resolver`:**

Change `Resolver::new(db, source_root, scope)` →
`Resolver::new(db, scope)`. The resolver derives `source_root` from
`scope.source_root(db)`. Old callers temporarily construct a scope
that embeds the source root.

**Step 1d — Migrate queries one by one:**

For each query (`fn_signature`, `struct_signature`, `enum_signature`,
`resolve_body`, `expanded_module`), remove the `source_root` and
`module` parameters; derive them from the symbol's scope internally.
Tests pass between each migration.

**Step 1e — Delete `*_defining_module` helpers** once nothing needs
them.

### Phase 2: Items know their scope (`Local*Symbol` wrappers)

**Goal:** Each item is a salsa tracked struct that knows its enclosing
scope, enabling single-keyed queries.

**Step 2a — Introduce `LocalFnSymbol`, `LocalStructSymbol`, etc.:**

```rust
#[salsa::tracked]
struct LocalFnSymbol<'db> {
    scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>,
    ast: FnAst<'db>,   // existing CST — renamed to FnCst later (Phase 3)
}
```

These are thin wrappers. The existing `FnAst`, `StructAst`, etc.
remain as the CST/syntax layer. The new `Local*Symbol` types own the
scope linkage.

At this point, `ScopeSymbol` gains the `Fn(LocalFnSymbol)` variant
for items nested inside function bodies.

**Step 2b — Mint `Local*Symbol` during parsing:**

Parsing already walks items per file. The parser receives the owning
scope and mints `Local*Symbol` instances directly. For macro
expansions, the expansion query parses the expanded text and likewise
produces symbols scoped to the invoking module. The minting always
happens in a parse query — it just runs in multiple queries (file
parse, macro expansion parse).

**Step 2c — Migrate signature queries to single-keyed:**

```rust
#[salsa::tracked]
pub fn fn_signature(db, sym: LocalFnSymbol) -> FnSig { ... }
```

The query reads `sym.scope(db)` to construct the resolver. The
`SigLowerCtx` struct dissolves — its resolver construction and rib
setup become local to the query body.

**Step 2d — Migrate `body()` to single-keyed:**

```rust
impl<'db> LocalFnSymbol<'db> {
    #[salsa::tracked]
    pub fn body(self, db: &'db dyn Db) -> TypedBody<'db> {
        let resolved = resolve_body(db, self.ast(db), ...);
        let typed = type_check_body(db, &resolved, ...);
        typed
    }
}
```

Internally this calls existing resolution and inference code in
sequence. From outside, one query key, one result. `resolve_body`
becomes a private helper.

### Phase 3: Naming and taxonomy cleanup

**Goal:** Align naming with the target taxonomy.

- Optionally rename `FnAst` → `FnCst`, `StructAst` → `StructCst` (low priority — existing names are adequate)
- Introduce `#[derive(FromImpls)]` for grouping enum constructors
- Add delegating-method derives for the per-kind grouping enums
- Restructure `Symbol` / `SymbolData` to use the grouping-enum pattern from the Design section

This is cosmetic and can be done at any point after Phase 2.

### Sequencing

```
1a  LocalCrateSymbol (additive)
1b  ScopeSymbol::Crate variant
1c  Resolver stops taking source_root
1d  Migrate queries (one at a time, tests pass between each)
1e  Delete *_defining_module helpers
2a  Local*Symbol tracked structs (additive)
2b  Mint during parsing (file parse + macro expansion parse)
2c  Single-keyed signature queries (SigLowerCtx dissolves)
2d  Single-keyed body query (resolve + infer internally)
3   Naming/taxonomy cleanup (whenever)
```

Each numbered step is a commit or small PR. The system compiles and
tests pass at every boundary.

## Implementation notes (what was actually done)

### Phase 1: Complete

**1a — `LocalCrateSymbol` introduced** as `#[salsa::tracked]` (not
`#[salsa::input]` as originally planned, because it contains `ModAst<'db>`
which has a lifetime parameter incompatible with salsa inputs). The
driver creates one per crate.

**1b — `ScopeSymbol` gained `Crate` variant** plus a `Module(ModSymbol, SourceRoot)`
variant that carries the source root directly (instead of deriving it
via a parent-chain walk as originally envisioned). This is simpler
because `SourceRoot` is a cheap Copy salsa input handle. The
`source_root(db)` method on `ScopeSymbol` dispatches on both variants.

**1c — `Resolver::new` simplified** to `Resolver::new(db, scope)`.
It derives `source_root` from `scope.source_root(db)` internally.
All call sites migrated.

**1d — Signature and body queries migrated:**
- `fn_signature(db, sym, module, source_root)` → `fn_signature(db, sym, scope)`
- `struct_signature(db, sym, module, source_root)` → `struct_signature(db, sym, scope)`
- `enum_signature(db, sym, module, source_root)` → `enum_signature(db, sym, scope)`
- `resolve_body(db, fn_ast, module, source_root)` → `resolve_body(db, fn_ast, scope)`
- `lower_fn_sig(db, fn_ast, module, source_root, ...)` → `lower_fn_sig(db, fn_ast, scope, ...)`

The queries still take `scope` as an explicit parameter (not
single-keyed on symbol alone) because salsa tracked functions require
at least one salsa-struct parameter for memoization, and `FnSymbol` is
a plain `Copy` wrapper, not a salsa tracked struct.

**1e — `*_defining_module` helpers retained** because `check.rs` still
needs them to find the module that defines a cross-module struct
reference. They'll go away when items carry their scope.

### Phase 2: Complete

**2a — Kind symbols carry optional scope.** Rather than introducing
separate `LocalFnSymbol` tracked structs, the existing per-kind
wrappers (`FnSymbol`, `StructSymbol`, etc.) gained an
`Option<ScopeSymbol>` in their `Ast` variant. Construction via
`FnSymbol::local(ast, scope)` stores the scope; the legacy
`FnSymbol::ast(ast)` stores `None`. A `sym.scope()` accessor returns
`Option<ScopeSymbol>`.

This is lighter-weight than the RFD's original proposal of separate
salsa tracked structs, and avoids the ID-explosion that full tracked
wrappers would cause. The tradeoff: symbols without scope can still be
constructed (the `None` case), so the invariant isn't statically
enforced. Once all minting sites pass scope, the `Option` can be
replaced with a bare `ScopeSymbol` and the `ast()` constructor removed.

**2b — Item minting in resolution produces scoped symbols.**
`Symbol::local(item, scope)` and `Symbol::tuple_struct_ctor_local(s, scope)`
constructors were added. The `walk_entries` function in `resolve/mod.rs`
(the main memmap-walking resolution path) now mints all symbols with
`Symbol::local(*item, scope)` using `ScopeSymbol::Module(module, source_root)`.
The `Symbol` struct gained a `.scope()` accessor that delegates to the
inner kind-symbol. The test harness (`sage-test-harness`) also mints
`FnSymbol::local(fn_ast, scope)`.

**2c — Single-keyed signature queries added:**
- `fn_sig(db, sym)` — reads scope from symbol, delegates to `fn_signature`
- `struct_sig(db, sym)` — reads scope from symbol, delegates to `struct_signature`
- `enum_sig(db, sym)` — reads scope from symbol, delegates to `enum_signature`

The two-parameter versions (`fn_signature(db, sym, scope)`) remain as
the underlying salsa tracked functions and as a fallback for symbols
that lack scope. The single-keyed wrappers panic if scope is missing.

**2d — Type checker uses scoped symbols directly.** The `check_struct_lit`
and `check_field_access` functions in `sage-infer/src/check.rs` now use
`struct_sig(db, sym)` when the symbol carries scope (bypassing the old
`struct_defining_module` helper), falling back to `struct_signature` with
a constructed scope when the symbol lacks one.

**1e — `*_defining_module` helpers deleted.** With scoped symbols flowing
through resolution, the `struct_defining_module`, `fn_defining_module`,
and `enum_defining_module` helpers in `scope.rs` are no longer needed.
They have been deleted along with the `find_module_for_file` /
`search_module_tree` support functions they depended on.

### Phase 3: Not started

Naming cleanup, `FromImpls` derive, and taxonomy restructuring are
deferred — the current names are adequate.

### Phase 2e: Scope made non-optional, Symbol::ast() removed

**`CheckEnv` simplified.** The `module` and `source_root` fields were
replaced by a single `scope: ScopeSymbol<'db>`. The `type_check_body`
function now takes `scope` instead of `(module, source_root)`.

**`SageContext.source_root` field removed.** Replaced by a
`source_root()` method that derives it from `krate.source_root(db)`.
All call sites migrated to use the method.

**`definition()` gained `source_root` parameter.** This allows it to
mint scoped symbols via `Symbol::local(item, scope)` instead of the
unscoped `Symbol::ast(item)`. All callers already had `source_root`
in scope.

**`Symbol::ast()` removed.** The scopeless constructor and
`tuple_struct_ctor()` helper were deleted. Only `Symbol::local(item,
scope)` and `Symbol::tuple_struct_ctor_local(s, scope)` remain for
local symbol construction. The `From<ItemAst> for Symbol` impl was
also removed.

**`Option<ScopeSymbol>` dropped from kind symbol data.** The internal
`$DataName::Ast($AstTy, Option<ScopeSymbol<'db>>)` variant was changed
to `$DataName::Ast($AstTy, ScopeSymbol<'db>)`. The `::ast()` constructor
on all kind symbols (`FnSymbol`, `StructSymbol`, etc.) was removed; only
`::local(ast, scope)` remains. The `scope()` method now returns
`Option<ScopeSymbol>` (Some for Ast, None for Ext) instead of the
double-Option.

**Signature lowering uses scoped parent symbols.** The `build_generics_ribs`
calls in `fn_signature`, `struct_signature`, and `enum_signature` now pass
`Symbol::local(item, scope)` as the parent rather than `Symbol::ast(item)`.

### Steps 1–3: Complete

#### Step 1 — `sage-infer` merged into `sage-ir`

Moved all `sage-infer/src/` files into `sage-ir/src/infer/` as a new
`pub mod infer` submodule. Imports changed from `sage_ir::` → `crate::`
and `crate::` → `super::`. Added `smallvec` to `sage-ir` deps.
`sage-test-harness` now imports from `sage_ir::infer::check`. The
`crates/sage-infer/` directory was deleted.

#### Step 2 — R-types renamed to Checked-types

Mechanical rename across 4 files (`resolved.rs`, `body_resolve.rs`,
`infer/check.rs`, `display.rs`):

- `RBody` → `CheckedBody`
- `RExpr` → `CheckedExpr`, `RExprKind` → `CheckedExprKind`
- `RStmt` → `CheckedStmt`, `RStmtKind` → `CheckedStmtKind`
- `RPat` → `CheckedPat`, `RPatKind` → `CheckedPatKind`
- `RMatchArm` → `CheckedMatchArm`
- `RClosureParam` → `CheckedClosureParam`
- `RFieldInit` → `CheckedFieldInit`
- `RFieldPat` → `CheckedFieldPat`

The `ResolvedBody` type alias was kept (it points to
`Stashed<Ptr<CheckedBody<'db>>>`) because the integration tests in the
`sage` crate still reference `resolve_body` directly and need a stable
type.

#### Step 3 — `TypedBody` and `fn_body` query

**3a — `TypedBody` defined** in `sage-ir/src/typed_body.rs`:

```rust
pub struct TypedBody<'db> {
    pub body: ResolvedBody<'db>,
    pub errors: Vec<String>,
}
```

Design deviation from the original plan: diagnostics are pre-rendered
to `Vec<String>` rather than stored as `Vec<Diagnostic<'db>>`. Reason:
`Diagnostic<'db>` holds `Ptr<Ty<'db>>` into the inference egraph's
`Stash`, and that `Stash` doesn't implement `salsa::Update` (it
contains a `HashMap`), so it cannot be stored in a salsa-tracked return
value. Pre-rendering keeps the memoized `fn_body` return type simple
while preserving full error message fidelity.

`TypedBody` implements `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and
`unsafe impl salsa::Update` to satisfy salsa's tracked-function
requirements.

**3b — `resolve_body` de-tracked.** The `#[salsa::tracked(returns(ref))]`
attribute was removed; it's now a plain function. Memoization is at the
`fn_body` level.

**3c — `fn_body` tracked function** sequences
`resolve_body` → `fn_signature` → `type_check_body` and returns
`TypedBody`. `FnSymbol::body(db)` is the ergonomic inherent method.

**3d — `sage-test-harness` uses `fn_sym.body(db)`** exclusively.
The harness no longer directly calls `resolve_body` or `type_check_body`.

**3e — Visibility not restricted** because the `sage` crate's
`body_resolve_tests.rs` integration tests still call `resolve_body`
directly to test name resolution in isolation (without type checking).
This is deferred to a cleanup step.

### Steps 4–5: Complete

#### Step 4 — Tests migrated to `fn_body`

`body_resolve_tests.rs` no longer calls `resolve_body` directly.
Instead it uses `FnSymbol::local(method, scope).body(db)` to get a
`TypedBody`, then pretty-prints `typed.body`. The query-log tests
similarly go through `fn_body`.

`type_check_tests.rs` already used `fn_sym.body(db)` via the
`sage-test-harness`, so no changes needed there.

#### Step 5 — Visibility restricted

- `resolve_body` → `pub(crate)` (was `pub`)
- `type_check_body` → `pub(crate)` (was `pub`)
- `TypeCheckResult` and its methods → `pub(crate)`
- `body_resolve` module → `pub(crate) mod` (was `pub mod`)
- `infer` module → `pub(crate) mod` (was `pub mod`)

External consumers use `FnSymbol::body(db) -> &TypedBody` exclusively.

#### Low-priority follow-ups

- Propagate scope through `resolve_module_path` so the `dummy_root`
  pattern in std-prelude and derive resolution can be eliminated
  (correctness unaffected since those paths only resolve external
  modules).
- Fold inference results directly into `CheckedExpr` nodes (single-pass
  body walk).
- Replace pre-rendered `Vec<String>` with structured diagnostics once a
  salsa-friendly diagnostic type is designed (e.g. span + message code
  without internal Ty pointers).
